How much should Rachel budget if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how much Rachel should budget for her shoes and dress. We know that Sara spent $50 on shoes and $200 on a dress. We also know that Rachel wants to spend twice as much as Sara did on her shoes and dress. \n\nSo, Rachel's budget for her shoes should be $50 x 2 = $100. \n\nTo find out how much Rachel should budget for her dress, we need to multiply the cost of Sara's dress by 2. So, Rachel's budget for her dress should be $200 x 2 = $400. \n\nTherefore, Rachel should budget $100 for her shoes and $400 for her dress. \n\nThe final answer is '#### 440'.",
