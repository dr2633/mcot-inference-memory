How much did she earn?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: Determine the hourly rate of babysitting.\nThe problem states that Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of hours worked.\nThe problem states that Weng did 50 minutes of babysitting. To convert minutes to hours, we divide the minutes by 60. 50 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.83 hours.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total earnings.\nNow that we know Weng worked 0.83 hours, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours worked to find her total earnings. $12/hour * 0.83 hours = $9.96.\n\nFinal answer: $9.96.",
