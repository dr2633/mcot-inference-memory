If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nFirst find the total number of snakes eaten by the jaguars: 6 jaguars * 5 snakes / jaguar = 30 snakes. Then find the total number of birds eaten by the snakes: 30 snakes * 3 birds / snake = 90 birds. Then find the total number of beetles eaten by the birds: 90 birds * 12 beetles / bird = 1080 beetles.\nThe answer is therefore 1080.",
