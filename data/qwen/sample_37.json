How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of the hamburgers.\n5 pieces of hamburger at $3 each = $15\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total cost of the French fries.\n4 sets of French fries at $1.20 each = $4.80\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total cost of the soda.\n5 cups of soda at $0.5 each = $2.50\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total cost of the spaghetti.\n1 platter of spaghetti at $2.70 = $2.70\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total cost of all the items.\n$15 (hamburgers) + $4.80 (French fries) + $2.50 (soda) + $2.70 (spaghetti) = $25\n\nStep 6: Divide the total cost by the number of friends to find the cost per person.\n$25 / 5 friends = $5\n\nFinal answer: Each friend will pay $5.",
