They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the Reese's treats. There are 4 bags of Reese's, and each bag costs $9. So, the total cost of Reese's is 4 bags * $9 per bag = $36.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the Snickers treats. There are 3 bags of Snickers, and each bag costs $5. So, the total cost of Snickers is 3 bags * $5 per bag = $15.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the Skittles treats. There are 5 bags of Skittles, and each bag costs $7. So, the total cost of Skittles is 5 bags * $7 per bag = $35.\n\nNow, let's add up the cost of all the treats: $36 (Reese's) + $15 (Snickers) + $35 (Skittles) = $86.\n\nFinally, let's add the cost of the unicorn pi\u00f1ata: $13 (unicorn pi\u00f1ata) + $86 (treats) = $99.\n\nSo, the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether $99.",
