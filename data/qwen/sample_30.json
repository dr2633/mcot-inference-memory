Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas, so they eat 2 pieces each. Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas, so they eat 3 pieces each. \n\nNext, we can add up the pieces of pizza that each person eats: 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10 pieces. \n\nNow, we can subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces: 4 x 4 = 16 pieces. \n\nFinally, we can divide the number of pieces eaten by the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces are left uneaten: 16 / 10 = 1.6. \n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a piece of pizza, we can round up to the nearest integer: 2 pieces. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.",
