How much did Mr. Benson pay in all?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets before the discount.\n2. Calculate the discount amount for each ticket.\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost of the tickets.\n4. Calculate the final cost of the tickets.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of the tickets before the discount.\nMr. Benson bought 12 tickets, so the total cost before the discount is:\n12 tickets * $40 per ticket = $480\n\nStep 2: Calculate the discount amount for each ticket.\nMr. Benson received a 5% discount for each ticket bought that exceeds 10. Since he bought 12 tickets, he received a discount for 12 - 10 = 2 tickets.\n\nThe discount amount for each ticket is:\n2 tickets * 5% discount = $2 per ticket\n\nStep 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost of the tickets.\nNow, we need to subtract the discount amount from the total cost of the tickets:\n$480 (total cost before discount) - $2 (discount amount per ticket) = $478\n\nStep 4: Calculate the final cost of the tickets.\n",
