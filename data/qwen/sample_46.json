If she practice six days a week, how many minutes does she spend practicing in a month with four weeks?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nFirst, let's find out how long Carolyn practices the violin each day. We know that she practices the violin for three times as long as the piano, so if she practices the piano for 20 minutes, she practices the violin for 3 * 20 = 60 minutes.\n\nNext, let's find out how many minutes Carolyn practices the violin in a week. She practices the violin for 60 minutes each day, so in a week, she practices the violin for 60 * 7 = 420 minutes.\n\nNow, let's find out how many minutes Carolyn practices the violin in a month. There are four weeks in a month, so she practices the violin for 420 * 4 = 1680 minutes in a month.\n\nFinally, let's find out how many minutes Carolyn practices the piano in a month. She practices the piano for 20 minutes each day, so in a month, she practices the piano for 20 * 30 = 600 minutes.\n\nTo find the total number of minutes Carolyn practices in a month, we add the minutes she practices the violin and the piano: 1680 + 600 = 228",
