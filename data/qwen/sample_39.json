Her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking in a neighboring subdivision where he gets 11 pieces of candy per house. If the first subdivision has 60 houses and the second subdivision has 75 houses, how many more pieces of candy does Anna get?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Anna gets in the first subdivision.\nAnna gets 14 pieces of candy per house in the first subdivision, and there are 60 houses in the subdivision. So, the total number of pieces of candy Anna gets in the first subdivision is:\n14 pieces/house * 60 houses = 840 pieces\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of candy Billy gets in the second subdivision.\nBilly gets 11 pieces of candy per house in the second subdivision, and there are 75 houses in the subdivision. So, the total number of pieces of candy Billy gets in the second subdivision is:\n11 pieces/house * 75 houses = 825 pieces\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference in the number of pieces of candy Anna and Billy get.\nTo find the difference, subtract the number of pieces of candy Billy gets from the number of pieces of candy Anna gets:\n840 pieces - 825 pieces = 15 pieces\n\nThe final answer is: #### 15.",
