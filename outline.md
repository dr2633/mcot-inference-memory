# Memory-Guided Chain-of-Thought (mCoT)

## Introduction

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables models to break down complex problems into intermediate steps, improving interpretability and reasoning depth. However, CoT lacks personalization, treating every inference independently without recalling prior user interactions or refining responses based on historical context.

### Limitations of Task-Based Benchmarks in Evaluating Long-Term User Interaction
Most existing benchmarks evaluate static performance on predefined tasks, failing to measure how well models adapt to long-term user engagement. Personalization, continuity, and adaptability are critical missing components in evaluating AI reasoning systems over multiple interactions.

### Benefits of Integrating Memory into CoT at Inference-Time
Introducing memory retrieval at inference-time enhances CoT by:
- Enabling models to recall user preferences and past errors.
- Refining reasoning based on personalized trajectories.
- Facilitating a more adaptive and iterative learning experience for users.

## Memory-Guided Chain-of-Thought (mCoT)

### Introducing mCoT: Grounding CoT Reasoning in User-Specified Memory
mCoT extends CoT by incorporating user-specific memory retrieval, dynamically adapting reasoning steps to previous interactions. This enables context-aware reasoning that aligns with user expectations and past experiences.

### Pretrained Weights as DNA, mCoT as mRNA
We conceptualize mCoT through a biological analogy:
- Pretrained weights (DNA) encode general knowledge.
- mCoT (mRNA) translates this knowledge into personalized, dynamic outputs.
- Memory retrieval acts as an epigenetic mechanism, allowing selective activation and modulation of reasoning pathways.

### Epigenetic Regulation of Reasoning Trajectories
Memory in mCoT functions as an epigenetic layer that:
- Specifies and filters relevant user history.
- Shapes how prior experiences influence current inference.
- Allows user-controlled adaptation of model reasoning.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Memory-Conditioned Reasoning

### CoT Decomposes Complex Problems but Lacks Memory
CoT improves step-by-step reasoning, particularly with few-shot prompting, but does not retain user-specific learning trajectories. Each inference session operates in isolation, ignoring previous interactions.

### Retrieving Prior Reasoning Chains for Refinement
mCoT leverages memory retrieval to refine intermediate steps by:
- Accessing relevant past inferences.
- Filtering and modifying step-wise outputs based on past errors and corrections.
- Improving adaptability to user-specific problem-solving patterns.

### User-Controlled Memory: Shaping Personalized Reasoning
Users can modify memory storage, enabling:
- Customizing inference behavior to align with their thought process.
- Iterative refinement of reasoning across multiple interactions.
- Greater control over AI reasoning at inference-time.

## Inference Preference Optimization: Extending GRPO with Memory

### The Better Lesson from DeepSeek: GRPO + Data Filtering
DeepSeekâ€™s Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) introduced an efficient RLHF alternative by:
- Optimizing relative preference comparisons.
- Incorporating data filtering for high-quality learning.

### Extending Preference Optimization to Inference-Time Reasoning
mCoT extends GRPO to optimize inference-time reasoning by:
- Adapting CoT outputs based on memory-conditioned preference learning.
- Refining response coherence with user preferences.
- Iteratively improving inference behavior through feedback loops.

### Framework for Inference Preference Optimization (IPO)
mCoT integrates Inference Preference Optimization (IPO), which:
- Uses retrieved memory to condition model outputs.
- Fine-tunes reasoning without requiring explicit retraining.
- Enables real-time preference alignment at inference-time.

## Conclusion
Memory-Guided Chain-of-Thought (mCoT) bridges the gap between static CoT reasoning and adaptive, user-personalized inference. By integrating memory retrieval and preference optimization, mCoT:
- Enhances personalization through real-time user interaction.
- Optimizes reasoning quality with memory-conditioned inference.
- Sets a new standard for benchmarking adaptive AI reasoning capabilities.
