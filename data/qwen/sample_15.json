How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nThoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of making each DVD.\nThe cost of making each DVD is $6.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the selling price of each DVD.\nThe selling price of each DVD is 2.5 times the cost of making it, which is 2.5 * $6 = $15.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the revenue generated by selling 500 DVDs in a day.\nThe revenue generated by selling 500 DVDs in a day is 500 * $15 = $7500.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the revenue generated in a week.\nThe revenue generated in a week is 500 * $7500 = $375000.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the profit made in a week.\nThe profit made in a week is the revenue generated in a week minus the cost of making the DVDs, which is $375000 - $2000 = $373000.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the profit made in 20 weeks.\nThe profit made in 20 weeks is the profit made in a week multiplied by 20, which is $3",
