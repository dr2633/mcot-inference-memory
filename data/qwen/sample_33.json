Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that she needs to make the pizza.\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza. \n\nFirst, we know that Kimber needs 10 cups of water. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many teaspoons of salt she needs. We know that she needs 1/2 as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Since she needs 16 cups of flour, we can multiply 16 by 1/2 to get 8 teaspoons of salt. \n\nNow we can add up the number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt to get the total number of ingredients needed. \n\n10 cups of water + 16 cups of flour + 8 teaspoons of salt = 34 cups of ingredients \n\nTherefore, Kimber needs a total of 34 cups of ingredients to make the pizza.",
