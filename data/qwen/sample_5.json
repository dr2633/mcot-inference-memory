There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many purple flowers Mark has. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so we can calculate the number of purple flowers as follows:\n\nPurple flowers = 10 (yellow flowers) + 0.8 (10 yellow flowers) = 18\n\nNext, we need to find out how many green flowers Mark has. We know that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so we can calculate the number of green flowers as follows:\n\nGreen flowers = (10 + 18) / 4 = 14\n\nFinally, we can add up the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to find the total number of flowers in Mark's garden:\n\nTotal flowers = 10 + 18 + 25 = 53\n\nTherefore, Mark has 53 flowers in his garden.",
