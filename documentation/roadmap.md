## **1. Implement and Refine Core Scripts**

### **1.1. Develop and Test Baseline Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
- **Script:** `run_baseline_cot.py`
- **Goal:** Establish a benchmark performance on **GSM8K** using **standard CoT prompting**.
- **Tasks:**
  - Load GSM8K dataset (`ds = load_dataset("openai/gsm8k", "main")`).
  - Implement standard Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
  - Evaluate correctness and reasoning trace quality.

### **1.2. Integrate Memory for Personalized Chain-of-Thought**
- **Script:** `run_memory_cot.py`
- **Goal:** Modify CoT to **retrieve user-specific memory** and generate customized solutions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement a **memory retrieval system** (initially JSON-based, later using FAISS).
  - Structure CoT prompts to incorporate **retrieved memory** about the userâ€™s past struggles, strengths, and preferences.
  - Evaluate differences in reasoning trajectories between **CoT vs. mCoT**.

### **1.3. Implement FAISS for Efficient Memory Retrieval**
- **Script:** `memory_store.py`
- **Goal:** Store and retrieve past user interactions efficiently.
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up **FAISS** as a vector store for memory retrieval.
  - Define an embedding strategy to encode past interactions.
  - Implement query-based memory retrieval to condition model reasoning.

## **2. Implement GRPO for Preference Optimization**
- **Script:** `train_rl_memory.py`
- **Goal:** Train the model using **GRPO** to refine mCoT responses based on personalized user feedback.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Load Transformer Model**: Use `AutoModelForCausalLM` for inference-time reasoning.
  - **Define Custom Reward Function**:
    - Correctness of the final answer.
    - Alignment with user-specific memory.
    - Adherence to user preferences (formatting, complexity, step-by-step guidance).
  - **Set Up GRPO Training**:
    - Use `GRPOTrainer` from `trl`.
    - Feed training samples conditioned on **retrieved memory**.
    - Optimize model responses for **higher personalization fidelity**.
  - **Evaluate Training Performance**:
    - Track reward trends and performance changes across iterations.
    - Compare **vanilla CoT vs. memory-augmented CoT (mCoT) vs. GRPO-trained mCoT**.

## **3. Benchmark and Evaluate Model Performance**
- **Script:** `evaluate_cot_vs_mcot.py`
- **Goal:** Conduct controlled experiments to quantify how memory improves model reasoning.
- **Tasks:**
  - Define **key evaluation metrics**:
    - **Accuracy**: Does the model produce correct answers?
    - **Coherence**: Is the reasoning logically sound?
    - **Personalization Fidelity**: Does it reflect user-specific preferences?
    - **Adaptability**: Does it improve across multiple sessions?
  - Run **GSM8K evaluations** comparing:
    - **CoT vs. mCoT** (memory integration impact).
    - **mCoT vs. GRPO-trained mCoT** (preference learning impact).

## **4. Expand Personalization Features**
- **Goal:** Improve personalization by integrating richer **user history tracking** and **adaptive learning mechanisms**.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Expand Memory Representation**:
    - Track user **error types** (e.g., calculation vs. conceptual misunderstandings).
    - Store metadata on **how users engage with model explanations**.
  - **User-Specific Prompt Engineering**:
    - Dynamically adjust **explanation styles** (formal vs. informal, detailed vs. concise).
    - Implement **graded difficulty scaling** based on past performance.
  - **Real-Time Adaptation**:
    - Implement **blindspot detection** to proactively address weaknesses.
    - Train the model to **predict user mistakes** based on historical responses.

## **5. Improve Model Efficiency and Scalability**
- **Goal:** Optimize system design for **faster inference and better memory retrieval**.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Optimize FAISS Indexing**:
    - Experiment with different **embedding models** for better memory retrieval.
    - Test **approximate nearest neighbor search** for faster access.
  - **Efficient CoT Computation**:
    - Explore **LoRA** or **adapter-based fine-tuning** to reduce computational costs.
    - Implement **response caching** for frequent queries.
  - **Scalability Testing**:
    - Evaluate performance across **larger datasets** (e.g., MATH dataset, RealWorldQA).
    - Benchmark inference time **with vs. without memory retrieval**.

## **6. Test Deployment and Real-World Use Cases**
- **Goal:** Move from experimental scripts to a working prototype that can adapt to real users.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Create an Interactive Notebook**:
    - Develop a **Colab/Jupyter demo** where users solve math problems with memory-enhanced feedback.
  - **Simulate User Trajectories**:
    - Test **multiple user profiles** to track how the model adapts.
    - Simulate students at different **grade levels** with varying knowledge gaps.
  - **Deploy API for Real-Time Testing**:
    - Set up a minimal API using **FastAPI** to allow user interactions.
    - Track **real user behavior** and fine-tune response adaptation strategies.

## **7. Future Research Directions**
- **Goal:** Extend the research by exploring novel inference-time optimizations and human-model collaboration strategies.
- **Ideas:**
  - **Hybrid Memory Models**: Combine **semantic search + retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.
  - **Self-Correction via Memory**: Can a model **critique its past CoT steps** and refine its response in real-time?
