How many stamps did Bella buy in all?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the total number of stamps Bella bought. We know that Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps, and she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = 20. We also know that Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 20 - 13 = 7. Now, we can add up the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps to find the total number of stamps Bella bought. \n\nTotal number of stamps = 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose) = 38. \n\nTherefore, Bella bought 38 stamps in all.",
