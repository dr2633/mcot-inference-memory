If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: Let's start by finding the length of Bobbie's last name. We know that Bobbie's last name has three fewer letters than Samantha's last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. So, we can write the equation:\n\nBobbie's last name length = Samantha's last name length - 3\nBobbie's last name length = Jamie's last name length * 2\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find Jamie's last name length. We know that Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. So, Jamie's last name length = 4 (since Jamie's first name is Jamie and Grey is a 4-letter word).\n\nStep 3: We can now substitute Jamie's last name length into the equation from Step 2:\n\nBobbie's last name length = 4 * 2\nBobbie's last name length = 8\n\nStep 4: We know that Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. So, we can write the equation:\n\nSamantha's last name length = Bobbie's last name length",
