We know that she spent the full credit limit of $100 and paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. So, we can subtract these amounts from the total credit limit to find out how much credit she still needs to pay. \n\n$100 - $15 - $23 = $62\n\nTherefore, Mary needs to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.",
