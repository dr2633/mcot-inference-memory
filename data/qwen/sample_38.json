We know that Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. So, for every 8 ounces of tea, she uses one ounce of tea. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party. We know that the party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. So, we need to find out how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for 12 6-ounce cups of tea. \n\nTo do this, we can use the ratio of 8 ounces of tea to one ounce of tea. We can set up a proportion to find out how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for 12 6-ounce cups of tea. \n\nLet x be the number of ounces of tea Artemis needs for 12 6-ounce cups of tea. \n\nWe can set up the proportion as follows: \n\n8 ounces of tea / 1 ounce of tea = x ounces of tea / 12 6-ounce cups of tea \n\nWe can simplify this proportion by",
