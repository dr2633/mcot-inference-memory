If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nNoah sold 8 large paintings for $60 each, so his total sales from large paintings last month were 8 x $60 = $480. He also sold 4 small paintings for $30 each, so his total sales from small paintings last month were 4 x $30 = $120. His total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $600. This month, he sold twice as many paintings, so he sold 2 x 8 = 16 large paintings. He also sold 2 x 4 = 8 small paintings. His total sales this month will be 16 x $60 = $960 for large paintings and 8 x $30 = $240 for small paintings. Therefore, his total sales this month will be $960 + $240 = $1200.",
