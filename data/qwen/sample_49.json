If Laurie collected 36 shells how many did Alan collect?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of shells Ben collected.\nSince Ben collected a third of what Laurie did, and Laurie collected 36 shells, we can find the number of shells Ben collected by multiplying 36 by 1/3.\n36 * 1/3 = 12\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of shells Alan collected.\nAlan collected four times as many shells as Ben did, so we can find the number of shells Alan collected by multiplying the number of shells Ben collected by 4.\n12 * 4 = 48\n\nFinal answer: Alan collected 48 shells.",
