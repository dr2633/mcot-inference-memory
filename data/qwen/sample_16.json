If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: Determine the total profit\nSince the profit is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson, we need to find the total profit. We know that Johnson got $2500, so we can set up the equation:\n\nTotal Profit = Johnson's share + Johnson's share\nTotal Profit = 2500 + 2500\nTotal Profit = 5000\n\nStep 2: Determine Mike's share\nWe know that Mike's share is in the ratio 2:5, so we can set up the equation:\n\nMike's share = (2/7) * Total Profit\nMike's share = (2/7) * 5000\nMike's share = 1000\n\nStep 3: Determine how much Mike has after spending some of his share on a shirt\nWe know that Mike spent some of his share on a shirt that costs $200. We can set up the equation:\n\nMike's share - $200 = Remaining share\n1000 - $200 = Remaining share\nRemaining share = 800\n\nStep 4: Determine how much Mike has after spending some of his share on a shirt\n",
