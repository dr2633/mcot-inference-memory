How many bananas would each monkey get if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nFirst, let's find out how many bananas are in each pile of bananas. \n\nFor the 6 piles with 9 hands each, we have 6 x 9 = 54 hands. Each hand has 14 bananas, so there are 54 x 14 = 756 bananas in those piles. \n\nFor the remaining 6 piles, we have 6 x 12 = 72 hands. Each hand has 9 bananas, so there are 72 x 9 = 648 bananas in those piles. \n\nNow, let's add the bananas from both types of piles: 756 + 648 = 1404 bananas. \n\nTo divide these bananas equally amongst the 12 monkeys, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey would get. We can do this by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys: 1404 / 12 = 117 bananas. \n\nTherefore, each monkey would get 117 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.",
