Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the weight of the box after each step:\n\nWeight of box after adding jelly beans = 2 pounds\nWeight of box after adding brownies = 3 * 2 pounds = 6 pounds\nWeight of box after adding jelly beans again = 2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds\nWeight of box after adding gummy worms = 2 * 4 pounds = 8 pounds\n\nTherefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 8 pounds.",
