  "question": "An earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake?",

Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nStep 1: The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse.\nStep 2: The second earthquake caused double the number of collapsing buildings as the first one, so 4 x 2 = 8 buildings collapsed.\nStep 3: The third earthquake caused double the number of collapsing buildings as the second one, so 8 x 2 = 16 buildings collapsed.\nStep 4: The fourth earthquake caused double the number of collapsing buildings as the third one, so 16 x 2 = 32 buildings collapsed.\nStep 5: Add the number of buildings from the first earthquake to the number of buildings from each subsequent earthquake: 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 60 buildings collapsed.\n\nFinal answer: #### 60",
