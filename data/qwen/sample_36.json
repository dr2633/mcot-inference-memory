How much more money did Lisa earn than Tommy?\nLet's reason through this step by step.\nShow all steps of your reasoning and conclude with the final answer in the format '#### <integer>'.\nStudent:\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much Lisa earned. We know that half of the $60 was earned by Lisa, so we can divide $60 by 2 to find out how much Lisa earned: $60 / 2 = $30. \n\nNext, we need to find out how much Tommy earned. We know that Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so we can multiply $30 by 1/2 to find out how much Tommy earned: $30 * 1/2 = $15. \n\nTo find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, we can subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings: $30 - $15 = $15. \n\nTherefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.",
